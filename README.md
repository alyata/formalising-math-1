# Formalising the Soundness & Completeness Theorems for Propositional Logic

This is a formalisation of the proofs for the soundness & completeness theorems
of classical propositional logic with the ⋀, ⋁, ⊥, ~ connectives in Lean,
submitted as my first project for Imperial's Formalising Mathematics module.
